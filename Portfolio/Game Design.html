				<h3>Description</h3>
			<p > - The this game is a small 2d platformer level made in unity. It was a project for my Game development class at ISU. The player must collect 10 coins and kill 5 enemies and then make it to the end goal in order to beat the game. Basic story of the game would be the player protecting the village from monsters.
			</p>

				<div class = "skills">
				<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>- The game is programmed in C# and uses collection mechanics as it's main function. I have  a understanding of the basics and fundamentals of C#. These skills were learned from my Game development class at ISU.</p>

					<h3>Description </h3>
				<p>
					- Lost space is a 3d platformer prototype where the player shoots enemies,collect health orbs if needed, and platform across to the door that leads to level 2. Level 2 would consist of the player collecting parts and interacting with other game objects as a way to "repair" broken machines. They would also have to shoot enemies.
				</p>
				</div>

			</section>
			<section>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3>Skills</h3>
					<p>- Just like the first project the game uses C# as it's code. I was able to code a shoot mechanic using delta time, and was able to have a collection mechanic with the parts. I also was able to have a functioning health bar work based on touch from enemies or health orbs. I was also able to program basic enemy tracking to player. </p>

						<h3>Description </h3>
					<p>
						- This is an Concept for a level in a Five nights at freddy's game that includes different types of encounters and exploration. A PDF is also given to describe the map and a description of each area in the level. Combat encounters are also a big portion of this project.
					</p>
					</div>

				<section>
					<div class = "skills">
						<h3>Skills</h3>
						<p>- The map and documentation shows my understanding of basic level/encounter design by drawing a map, drawing images and color coding certain areas. I got this understanding of combat encounters from my Game Design 2 course at ISU. </p>
